        <h1>How We Got Started?</h1>
      </div>
      <p>
        This group started April 4, 2020, when the Prophet Russell M. Nelson invited the world to fast on April 10 on 
        behalf of COVID-19. Over 500,000 people from the group alone joined in that day. We honor this historical day which 
        broke down religious, political, and cultural barriers. We will continue to break these barriers through stories, 
        prayers, fasting, and action. These actions include, but are not limited to, helping people with mental health, 
        eliminating poverty, stopping human sex trafficking, helping people help themselves, providing clean water to those 
        in need, helping orphans find a home and family, promote religion, and any other means whereby we can show love 
        to others on micro and macro scales. We invite all to join us on this quest to unify hearts for the good of mankind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Worldwide Unified works tirelessly to support causes that change lives and promote people to love their neighbor. 
        Regardless of what religion or who you worship we invite you to accept our differences, unify the human family, and 
        work on breaking down religious, ethnic, and cultural barriers.  
      </p>
      <p>
        In a world of different religions, ethnicities and cultures, our hope is to be united in attributes of love. 
        We seek for things that are virtuous, praiseworthy, and for the good of mankind, that we may both achieve sustainable 
        societies and help to mend the broken heart of each individual. We call upon members of all faiths to join in our 
        efforts to make this vision a reality. We seek to strengthen the home, liberty, family and religion via acts of love.
        Love is the one thing that brings people of all walks of life together. More than riches, more than fame, more than
        self accomplishment; the one thing that everyone needs is to feel loved, and that is exactly what our mission 
        entails: love for Deity, love for oneself, and love for others.

        <h1>What We Do?</h1>
      </div>
      <div class = what>
        <p>
          As a humanitarian organization, our primary focus is to promote others to “love [and help] thy neighbor as
          thyself” (Matthew 22:39) through the means of social media outreach, merchandise, and humanitarian partnerships. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Our main social media outreach is a Facebook Group of over 500,000 followers in which members go to submit prayer 
          requests, music, miracle stories, and other messages of hope to inspire and meet the spiritual needs of people. 
          Other social platforms include a Facebook Page of over 2,500 followers and an Instagram Page with over 2,000 
          followers, each with the same core purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our current merchandise is the book Hope is not Quarantined which features real-life examples of love in action, 
          as posted by members of the Facebook Group. These stories (shared with author consent) offer inspiring testimonials 
          of the positive impact that faith, fasting, and prayer can have in the lives of individuals. While the book is 
          currently on Amazon, we hope to have a website that brands not only this book, but future merch such as wristbands 
          and T-shirts to spread the word. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Our partnerships are intended to help accomplish the vision of serving people around the world. We first partnered 
          with the Ugandan Water Project to build a rainwater collection system that will provide clean water to a village of
          about 200 people in Kijjabwemi Uganda. One of these villagers is a member of our Facebook Group, who brought the 
          need to our attention. We hope to partner with additional organizations and sponsors to expand our global impact
          (see Milestones and Achievements).
